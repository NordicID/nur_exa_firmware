## EXA device firmware
This repository contains stable releases of EXA31, EXA51 and EXA21 device firmwares.

## Updating instructions for EXA31/51
Use the RFIDDemo application for updating device (EXA) or RFID module (NUR) firmware.

Inorder to gain maximum RFID reading data through put, it's recommended to use **"exa_application_xxx-H**" (high speed) version with mobile phones / tablets equipped with Bluetooth version 4.2 or higher.
Use "**exa_application_xxx-L**" in applications where high data through put requirement is not critical or mobile phone doesn't work properly with -H version.
